# Code Breaker Ring Game

Code breaker ring game written in Java  using MVC design pattern

## About
Code Breaker Ring is a code breaking game of logic and memory.

Your aim is to crack the code fast enough to get a high score and make it onto our Master Code Breakers list.

## Rules

You get unlimited attempts at breaking the code. If you get frustrated you can always click I give up (top left corner of board) and the code will be revealed to you.

The Code Breaker code is made up of 6 colours from the 8 available colours. To win you must place the right marbles in the right order. After each attempt you will be told how you went.

    White marble - Means that there is one of your marbles in the code but not in the right place.
    Black marble - Means that there is one of your marbles in the code and in the right place.

The answer marbles are not in any particular order and don't line up with your code marbles.

## Playing the Game

The current hole is highlighted with a blue ring. To place a marble, select the colour you want from the available colours at the bottom of the board. When you are happy, click Accept. Your current status will be evaluated. The ring moves to the next hole and you are free to have your next attempt. Keep going until you crack the code.

To play a new game simply click New Game to the right of the board game..
